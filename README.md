# Java-Based-Orbital-Prediction-of-High-Proper-Motion-Stars-Using-Gaia-DR3-Astrometry
This project predicts future orbital trajectories of high proper motion stars using Gaia DR3 astrometry. A Java-based framework performs vector arithmetic, coordinate transformations, and Newtonian simulations. Data is fetched via the ESA TAP API for efficient, real-time analysis.
